# IronIQ - Clothing Material Ironing Guide App

## Description
IronIQ is an upcoming mobile application that aims to provide users with a convenient way to iron their clothes by offering temperature recommendations and ironing instructions based on the type of clothing material. With this app, users can ensure that they are using the correct ironing temperature for different fabrics, helping to prevent damage to their clothes.

## Key Features (Planned)
- Selection of clothing material icons for easy identification
- Temperature recommendations for different materials
- User input for customization and specific fabric blends
- Tutorial and educational content on ironing techniques and fabric care

## Project Status
This app is currently in the early stages of development. I am working on creating the basic user interface and implementing the core features. I plan to continually enhance and expand the app based on user feedback and requirements.

## Future Development
In future updates, I plan to include additional features such as:
- Temperature conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit
- Enhanced user interface and design improvements
- Integration with external fabric care resources
- Database expansion with a wider range of clothing materials

## Getting Started
As the project progresses, I will provide detailed instructions for installation and usage. Please stay tuned for updates.
